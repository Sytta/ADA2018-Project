# Who Do You Know at Risk for Mental Illness?

# Abstract

1 in 4 people globally will suffer from mental health or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. However, 2/3 of these people will never seek help, and 8 million lives are lost due to mental illnesses each year. Going forward, if we want to help those affected by this disease, it is important to identify which groups are at risk and what treatments are most effective.

Our goal for this project is separated into two components:
1. Develop insights on key risk factors of mental illness
2. Identify treatments/solutions that have or have not worked in the past

# Research questions
- Is mental illness prevalence similar across countries/regions?
    - If not, what could be the reason behind this? (ex. working hours, minimum wage laws, retirement age)
- What is the mental illness distribution over demographics including:
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Income
    - Education Level
    - Employment
    - Occupation
- Of those who sought out help: what has worked/has not worked for them?
- Suicide rates due to mental illnesses across regions

# Dataset

We will be using multiple datasets for this project. One major dataset is provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and is located here: http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/

The data contains information on adults who have reported depression and can be segmented by country, age, education level, and employment.
