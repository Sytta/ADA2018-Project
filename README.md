# Who is at Risk for Mental Illness?

# Abstract

1 in 4 people globally will suffer from mental health or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. However, 2/3 of these people will never seek help, and 8 million lives are lost due to mental illnesses each year. Going forward, if we want to help those affected by this disease, it is important to identify which groups are at risk and what treatments are most effective.

Our goal for this project is separated into two components:
1. Develop insights on key risk factors of mental illness
2. Identify treatments/solutions that have or have not worked in the past

We will be using multiple datasets for this project. One major dataset is provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and is located here: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=EAG_ESO#

The data contains information on adults who have reported depression and can be segmented by country, age, education level, and employment.

# Research questions
- Is mental illness prevalence similar across countries/regions?
    - If not, what could be the reason behind this? (ex. working hours, minimum wage laws, retirement age)
- What is the mental illness distribution over demographics including:
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Income
    - Education Level
    - Employment
    - Occupation
- Of those who sought out help: what has worked/has not worked for them?
- Suicide rates due to mental illnesses across regions

# Dataset

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Dataset: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=EAG_ESO#
The data is in CSV format and contains information on adults who have reported depression and can be segmented by country, age, education level, and employment.

GHDx Global Burden of Disease Study: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2016 
The link contains many datasets in CSV format. One dataset in particular includes the countries, year, population, and prevalence of mental illness in females/males as a %. Although not all country contains information, this will still be useful in analyzing how mental illness has changed over time (from 1800 - 2016), and it allows us to segment this data by country and gender.
