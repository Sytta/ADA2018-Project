                <div class="row-sm-1">Nearly 1 in every 5 Americans suffer from a mental disorder in a given year. What about the rest of the world?</div>

                <div class="row-sm-1"> 
                  <p>As can be seen in the map above, the countries’ share of population with mental illness consistently falls between 9% to 17%. The countries that the highest mental illness prevalence include: United States, Australia, Greenland and Iran.</p>
 
                  <p>The United States’ darkest period for mental illness fall between 2000 – 2009, which includes the time period when the 9/11 terrorist attack and financial crisis occurred. The 9/11 attack in 2000 resulted in almost 3K deaths and over 6K injuries. It led to a steep decline in the stock market index, followed by public backlash against those that came from specific race/religion groups.  Furthermore, the financial crisis starting in 2007 resulted in the loss of 8.7 million jobs in the US alone. Hence, it may be possible to attribute the high mental illness prevalence during these years to the economic and social repercussions of these two events.</p>

                <div class="row-sm-1"> 
                  <p>Mental disorders related deaths occur throughout the world, affecting individuals of all nations, cultures, religions and genders. We can see from the graph below  that the prevalence of mental disorders does not show a direct relationship with the death rates. In fact, statistics show that countries with highest mental disorder related death rates in the world are incredibly diverse. </p>
 
                  <p>Today, it is widely accepted by major scientific associations that addiction is a "brain disease". The DSM-V lists criteria for classifying addictions as mental health condition is called "Substance Use Disorder." Prior to 2016, the dataset provided by GHDx also included "Substance Use Disorder" as a type of "Mental Disorder".</p>

                  <p>For all the analysis on deaths caused by mental illness, we included alcohol use and drug use disorders to make it more comprehensive. If we take a look at the number of deaths caused by mental disorders, we can see that substance use disorders (drug and alcohol use) contribute to more than 100 k deaths per year. Specifically, Russian, Australia, the United States and Nordic countries appear to have the highest direct deaths rates reported from substance use disorders in 2016. China, India and the United States had the highest direct deaths from anorexia and bulimia nervosa, with more than 60 deaths each in 2016. </p>

                  <p> Let's take the look at the total number of mental disorder related deaths. Russia had the highest death rate at over 25 deaths per 100,000; this was followed closely by the United States with just over 24 per 100,000. Furthermore. it is worth noting that Russia has a decreasing death rates after peaking at 50 deaths per 100,000 in 2005, whereas the death rates for the United States has been increasing since 1990.  </p>

                  <p>Panama, Mexico and Nicaragua had a relatively low prevalence of mental illness of 12% comparing to other North America countries such as Canada (18%) and the United States (21%) in 2016. It is also reported that the world lowest suicide rates are concentrated in the Caribbean Islands. Perhaps surprisingly, only about 0.3 deaths per 100,000 were reported in Egypt. </p>

                  <p>These mental disordered related deaths do not include indirect suicide deaths and doctor-assisted suicide, which may significantly underestimate the true mortality impact of such disorders. </p>

                      anxiety and depression are the top mental illness per country. We can also observe that Americas
                      generally have a higher percentage of mentally ill population among all continents, varying from
                      0.23% to 5.3% over the years, followed by Europe, varying from 0.24% to 4.46%. Interestingly, these
                      are the richest and most developed countries. While researchers cannot give an explanation for this

              Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Idiopathic developmental intellectual disability. This
              might be due to medical advances and a wider social acceptance of these diseases.

              Africa has the highest population share for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Conduct
              disorders (not surprising since this is related to ADHD). A study from M. Döpfner et al. (2008) has related
              higher prevalence of ADHD in families of lower socioeconomic status and families from urban areas, but this
              doesn’t explain why Americans ended up ranking second.

              Surprisingly, while there is a general stereotype portraying how asian (especially East Asian) students are
              smart at school, Asia ranks first in the Idiopathic developmental intellectual disability and schizophrenia.
              While the reason is still unknown, from our research, we think that it might be related to the inequalility
              of the avaibility of the medical resources in the developing countries.

                    <p>The above graph shows the global depression prevalence as a % of the population, based on education and employment. Education is split into 3 categories—below upper secondary, upper secondary and post-secondary, and tertiary education. Employment is split into 2 overlapping categories—active and employed. Active considers all people in the labour force—this includes those who are employed, but also those who are unemployed but looking for work.</p>
 
                    <p>From the graph, it is clear that depression prevalence decreases as education level increases. Furthermore, depression prevalence is lower for employed rather than active, for all three levels of education. This negative correlation between depression prevalence and education/employment is intuitive—a person with higher education and is employed will on average experience more personal development, increased perspective of self-worth, and be more economically stable. Financial stability and self-fulfillment are contributing factors to the lower depression prevalence levels.</p><br> 
                    
                    <p>We decided to perform a hypothesis test to test the difference in depression prevalence between the active and employed groups. Using a two-sided t-test, we arrived at a final p-value of <b>0.0669035101009</b>. Using a 10% significance level, we rejected our null hypothesis and concluded that there is a significant difference in depression prevalence between active and employed groups. As seen above, unemployed people tend to be more depressed. (Details of the hypothesis formulation and calculations in <b>Show More</b>)</p>

                    <p>Let’s conduct a hypothesis test on the difference in means in depression prevalence between employed and active groups using a two-sided t-test. We first formulate our hypothesis:</p>
 
                    <p style="align-content: center">H0: Mean of employed group depression = Mean of active group depression<br>
                    H1: Mean of employed group depression != Mean of active group depression</p>
 
                    <p>Below are variables we need to conduct the p-test:</p>

                    $$s = \sqrt{{var_{employed} + var_{active}} \over 2} = 2.8308443427497183$$</p>

            <div class="col">
                <div class="row-sm-10 plot" id="mental_illness_life_satisfaction"></div>
                <div class="row-md-2">

                  <p>Life satisfaction data was obtained from the World Happiness Report. The happiness level is self-ranked by participants from each country who ranked the quality of their lives from a scale of 0-10. Top ranked countries had common high values in areas including: income, life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity.</p>
 
                  <p>Prior to plotting this graph, our team hypothesized that mental illness prevalence and life satisfaction would have a negative correlation—the higher the life satisfaction of a country, the lower the rate of mental illness, right?</p>
                   
                  <p>That is not what the data depicts, however.  In fact, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between mental illness prevalence and life satisfaction is positive at 0.477. We conducted some research online to identify the cause of this positive correlation, and we came across studies that indicated that data on mental illness may be lacking in developing countries, which are often countries with lower life satisfaction. For example, a developed country such as Canada will educate students and parents on mental disorders from an early age, and universities will offer and encourage treatment. On the other hand, a developing country such as India may ignore the severity of mental illness, perhaps having the perspective that it is not a real concern or illness, given the other problems the country is facing such as poverty. Hence it is possible that a person from a country with lower life satisfaction such as India will not even realize that they are affected by mental illness due to lack of education. Or, they may be unwilling to admit their disease due to fear of shame or judgement.</p>
